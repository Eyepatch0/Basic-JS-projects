* #  What I learnt:-
   1. Using Canvas API
   2. Generating random colors and numbers
* ## Problems and Improvements:-
    According to [Martin Ankerl](https://martin.ankerl.com/2009/12/09/how-to-create-random-colors-programmatically/ " Martin Ankerl ") - there seems to be a preference for darker colors using random for rgb, will try to implement it in hsv color space using golden ratio.
